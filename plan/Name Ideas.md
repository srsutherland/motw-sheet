# Current Name Shortlist
- MoTW Beyond (Working Title)

  - The Lodge
- Hunter's Haven 
  - Haven
- Investigate a Mystery
- Monster of the Sheets (This is such a bad pun but I love it)
- The Corkboard

# Criteria
- Should immediately evoke:
  - Specifically a *character sheet* app (not for session notes, case logs, lore, etc)
  - for *Monster of the Week* (should obviously be a reference to the game for anyone familiar with it)
  - for hunters (players), not primarily keepers (GMs)
- Should be applicable to all playbooks, not just a few
  - Note that the list above includes "Haven", which is specifically a move from the Expert playbook. This is a acceptable exception to this rule: 
    - The Haven is a move that's shared with the other hunters at the table, and functions as "home". 
    - Also, multiple playbooks can gain havens through improvements.
