# The Professional

*It’s kind of strange when your regular 9-to-5 job is to hunt down monsters. Still, that’s the job I took on when I joined this outfit. It pays well, and the benefits are good. Like they say “You don’t have to be crazy to work here, but it sure helps!”*

## Luck

(Luck track placeholder)

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 or avoid all harm.

**Professional Special:** When you spend a point of Luck, your next mission from the Agency comes with lots of Red Tape. Lots.

## Harm

(Harm track placeholder)

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Unstable: (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Experience

(Experience track placeholder)

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Moves

You get all the basic moves, plus four Professional moves.

Pick three of these:

- [ ] **Bottle It Up:** If you want, you can take up to +3 bonus when you act under pressure. For each +1 you use, the Keeper holds 1. That hold can be spent later—one for one—to give you -1 on any move except act under pressure.
- [ ] **Unfazeable:** Take +1 Cool (max +3).
- [ ] **Battlefield Awareness:** You always know what’s happening around you, and what to watch out for. Take +1 armour (max 2-armour) on top of whatever you get from your gear.
- [ ] **Leave No One Behind:** In combat, when you help someone escape, roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you get them out clean. On a 7-9, you can either get them out or suffer no harm, you choose. On a miss, you fail to get them out and you’ve attracted hostile attention.
- [ ] **Tactical Genius:** When you read a bad situation, you may roll +Cool instead of +Sharp.
- [ ] **Medic:** You have a full first aid kit, and the training to heal people. When you do first aid, roll +Cool. On a 10+ the patient is stabilized and healed of 2 harm. On a 7-9 choose one: heal 2 harm or stabilize the injury. On a miss, you cause an extra 1 harm. This move takes the place of regular first aid.
- [ ] **Mobility:** You have a truck, van, or car built for monster hunting. Choose two good things and one bad thing about it.
	- **Good things:** roomy; surveillance gear; fast; stealthy; intimidating; classic; medical kit; sleeping space; toolkit; concealed weapons; anonymous; armoured (+1 armour inside); tough; monster cage.
	- **Bad things:** loud; obvious; temperamental; beaten-up; gas-guzzler; uncomfortable; slow; old.

And you get this one:

- [x] **The Agency:** When you deal with the Agency, requesting help or gear, or making excuses for a failure, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you’re good—your request for gear or personnel is okayed, or your slip-up goes unnoticed. On a 7-9, things aren’t so great. You might get chewed out by your superiors and there’ll be fallout, but you get what you need for the job. On a miss, you screwed up: you might be suspended or under investigation, or just in the doghouse. You certainly aren’t going to get any help until you sort it all out.

## Gear

Pick one serious weapon and two normal weapons.
You get either a flak vest (1-armour hidden) or combat armour (2-armour heavy) for protection.

**Serious weapons (pick one):**

- [ ] Assault rifle (3-harm far area loud reload)
- [ ] Grenade launcher (4-harm far area messy loud reload)
- [ ] Sniper rifle (4-harm far)
- [ ] Grenades (4-harm close area messy loud)
- [ ] Submachine gun (3-harm close area loud reload)

**Normal weapons (pick two):**

- [ ] .38 revolver (2-harm close reload loud)
- [ ] 9mm (2-harm close loud)
- [ ] Hunting rifle (2-harm far loud)
- [ ] Shotgun (3-harm close messy)
- [ ] Big knife (1-harm hand)

## Basic Moves by Rating

- **CHARM:** Manipulate Someone
- **COOL:** Act Under Pressure; Help Out
- **SHARP:** Investigate a Mystery; Read a Bad Situation
- **TOUGH:** Kick Some Ass; Protect Someone
- **WEIRD:** Use Magic

## Introductions

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.
Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Professional by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- [ ] Your relationship with them has romantic potential. So far it hasn’t gone further.
- [ ] They’re on the Agency’s watch list, and you’ve been keeping an eye on them.
- [ ] You are related. Tell them how close.
- [ ] You met on a mission and worked together unofficially. And successfully.
- [ ] They’ve worked with the Agency before, and they’re well regarded.
- [ ] You were friends back in training, before the Agency recruited you. This could be military, law enforcement, or some weirder school: decide the details between you.
- [ ] They pulled you (and maybe your team) out of a terrible FUBARed mission.
- [ ] You got sent to “deal with them” as a hazard to the Agency’s policies one time. Tell them how you resolved this.

## Leveling Up

When you have filled all five experience boxes, you level up. Erase the marks and pick an improvement from the following list:

## Improvements

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They’re below.
