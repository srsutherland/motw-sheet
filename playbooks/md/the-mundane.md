# The Mundane

*You heard about how monsters only pick on people with crazy powers who can fight back on even terms? Yeah, me neither. But, hell, I ended up in this monster-hunting team so I gotta do what I can, right?*

## Luck

(Luck track placeholder)

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 or avoid all harm.

**Mundane Special:** When you spend a point of Luck, you’ll find something weird—maybe even useful!

## Harm

(Harm track placeholder)

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Unstable: (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Experience

(Experience track placeholder)

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Moves

You get all the basic moves, plus pick three Mundane moves:

- [ ] **Always The Victim:** When another hunter uses protect someone to protect you, they mark experience. Whenever a monster captures you, you mark experience.
- [ ] **Oops!** If you want to stumble across something important, tell the Keeper. You will find something important and useful, although not necessarily related to your immediate problems.
- [ ] **Let’s Get Out Of Here!** If you can protect someone by telling them what to do, or by leading them out, roll +Charm instead of +Tough.
- [ ] **Panic Button:** When you need to escape, name the route you’ll try and roll +Sharp. On a 10+ you’re out of danger, no problem. On a 7-9 you can go or stay, but if you go it’s going to cost you (you leave something behind or something comes with you). On a miss, you are caught halfway out.
- [ ] **The Power of Heart:** When fighting a monster, if you help someone, don’t roll +Cool. You automatically help as though you’d rolled a 10.
- [ ] **Trust Me:** When you tell a normal person the truth in order to protect them from danger, roll +Charm. On a 10+ they’ll do what you say they should, no questions asked. On a 7-9 they do it, but the Keeper chooses one from:
	- They ask you a hard question first.
	- They stall and dither a while.
	- They have a “better” idea.

	On a miss, they’re going to think you’re crazy and maybe dangerous too.
- [ ] **What Could Go Wrong?:** Whenever you charge into immediate danger without hedging your bets, hold 2. You may spend your hold to:
	- Inflict +1 harm.
	- Reduce someone’s harm suffered by 1.
	- Take +2 forward on an act under pressure roll.
- [ ] **Don’t Worry, I’ll Check It Out:** Whenever you go off by yourself to check out somewhere (or something) scary, mark experience.

## Gear

You get two Mundane weapons and a means of transport.

**Mundane weapons (pick two):**
- [ ] Golf club, baseball bat, cricket bat, or hockey stick (2-harm hand innocuous messy)
- [ ] Pocket knife or multitool (1-harm hand useful small)
- [ ] Small handgun (2-harm close loud reload)
- [ ] Hunting rifle (3-harm far loud reload)
- [ ] Sledge-hammer or fire axe (3-harm hand messy)
- [ ] Nunchuks (2-harm hand area)

**Means of transport (pick one):**
- [ ] Skateboard
- [ ] Bicycle
- [ ] Fairly new car in decent condition
- [ ] Classic car in terrible condition
- [ ] Motorcycle
- [ ] Van

## Introductions

When you get here, wait for everyone to catch up so you can do your introductions together.
Go around the group. On your turn, introduce your Mundane by name and look, and tell the group what they know about you.

## History

Go around the group again. When it’s your turn, pick one for each of the other hunters:

- [ ] You are close relations. Tell them exactly how you’re related.
- [ ] Initially rivals, you both now respect each others’ talents.
- [ ] Romantically involved, or you just have a crush on them. Ask them which they prefer.
- [ ] They’re your hero, exactly the kind of monster hunter you aspire to be. Tell them why you worship them.
- [ ] Good friends. Tell them if it’s from way back, or recently.
- [ ] You’re a bit suspicious of them (maybe due to their unnatural powers or something like that).
- [ ] They introduced you to the existence of monsters. Tell them how you feel about that.
