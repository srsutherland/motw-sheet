## Combat Magic

You have a few attack spells you can use as weapons.

When you use these spells to **kick some ass**, roll +Weird instead of +Tough.

Sometimes the situation may require you to **act under pressure** to cast your spell without problems.

Your combat spells can combine any of your base spells with any of your effects.

**Combat magic, pick three (with at least one base):**

**Bases:**
- **Blast:** 2-harm magic close obvious loud
- **Ball:** 1-harm magic area close obvious loud
- **Missile:** 1-harm magic far obvious loud
- **Wall:** 1-harm magic barrier close 1-armour obvious loud

**Effects:**
- **Fire:** Add '+2 harm fire' to a base. If you get a 10+ on a combat magic roll, the fire won't spread.
- **Force or Wind:** Add '+1 harm forceful' to a base, or '+1 armour' to a wall.
- **Lightning or Entropy:** Add '+1 harm messy' to a base.
- **Frost or Ice:** Adds '-1 harm +2 armour' to a wall, or '+1 harm restraining' to other bases.
- **Earth:** Add 'forceful restraining' to a base.
- **Necromantic:** Add 'life-drain' to a base.

## Moves

You get all the basic moves and four Spell-slinger moves.
You have this one:

### Tools and Techniques
To use your combat magic effectively you rely on a collection of tools and techniques. Cross off one; you'll need the rest.

- [ ] **Consumables:** You need certain supplies— powders, oils, etc— on hand, some will be used up each cast. If you don't have them, take 1-harm ignore-armour when you cast.
- [ ] **Consumables:** You need certain supplies—powders, oils, etc—on hand, some will be used up each cast. If you don't have them, take 1-harm ignore-armour when you cast.
- [ ] **Foci:** You need wands, staves, and other obvious props to focus. If you don't have what you need, your combat magic does 1 less harm.
- [ ] **Gestures:** You need to wave your hands around to use combat magic. If you're restrained, take -1 ongoing for combat magic.
- [ ] **Incantations:** You must speak in an arcane language to control your magic. If you use combat magic without speaking, act under pressure to avoid scrambling your thoughts.

Plus pick three of these:

### Advanced Arcane Training
If you have two of your three Tools and Techniques at the ready, you may ignore the third one.

### Arcane Reputation
Pick three big organizations or groups in the supernatural community. They've heard of you and respect your power. With affected humans, take +1 forward when you **manipulate** them. You may **manipulate** affected monsters as if they were human, with no bonus.

### Could've Been Worse
When you miss a **use magic** roll, choose one of the following options instead of losing control of the magic: Fizzle or This Is Gonna Suck.
- **Fizzle:** The preparations and materials for the spell are ruined. You'll have to start over from scratch with the prep time doubled.
- **This Is Gonna Suck:** The effect happens, but you trigger all of the listed glitches but one. You pick the one you avoid.

### Enchanted Clothing
Pick an article of everyday clothing—it's enchanted without any change in appearance. Take -1 harm from any source that tries to get at you through the garment.

### Forensic Divination
When you successfully **investigate a mystery**, ask 'What magic was done here?' as a free extra question.

### Go Big or Go Home
When you must **use magic** as a requirement for Big Magic, take +1 ongoing to those **use magic** rolls.

### Not My Fault
+1 to **act under pressure** when dealing with the consequences of your own spell-casting.

### Practitioner
Choose two effects available to you under **use magic**. Take +1 to **use magic** whenever you choose one of those effects.

### Shield Spell
When you **protect someone**, gain 2-armour against any harm that is transferred to you. This doesn't stack with your other armour, if any.

### Third Eye
When you **read a bad situation**, you can **open up your third eye** for a moment to take in extra information. Take +1 hold on any result of 7 or more. You can see invisible things. On a miss, you may still get 1 hold, but you're exposed to supernatural danger. Unfiltered hidden reality is rough on the mind!

## Gear

You don't need much—aside from any foci or consumables to power your magic. Still, it's good to carry some backup.
Pick one:
- **Old revolver:** 2-harm close reload loud
- **Ritual knife:** 1-harm hand
- **Heirloom sword:** 2-harm hand messy
