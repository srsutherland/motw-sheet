# The Initiate

*Since the dawn of history, we have been the bulwark against Darkness. We know the Evils of the world, and we stand against them so that the mass of humanity need not fear. We are the Flame that cleanses the Shadows.*

## Luck

(Luck track placeholder)

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 or avoid all harm.

**Initiate Special:** When you spend a point of Luck, something goes wrong for your Sect: an ill-advised project or a disastrous operation.

## Harm

(Harm track placeholder)

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Unstable: (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Experience

(Experience track placeholder)

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Moves

You get all of the basic moves, plus four Initiate moves. You get this one:

- [x] **Good Standing:** When you are in good standing with your Sect, at the beginning of each mystery, roll +Charm. On a 10+ they provide some useful info or help in the field. On a 7-9 you get a mission associated with the mystery, and if you do it you’ll get some info or help too. On a miss, they ask you to do something bad. If you fail a mission or refuse an order, you’ll be in trouble with the Sect until you atone.

Then pick three of these:

- [ ] **Ancient Fighting Arts:** When using an old-fashioned hand weapon, you inflict +1 harm and get +1 whenever you roll protect someone.
- [ ] **Mystic:** Every time you successfully use magic, take +1 forward.
- [ ] **Fortunes:** The Sect has ancient prophecies or divination techniques to predict the future. Once per mystery, you may use them. If you look at what the future holds, roll +Weird. On a 10+ hold 3, and on a 7-9 hold 1. On a miss, you get bad information and the Keeper decides how that affects you. Spend your hold to:
	- have a useful object ready.
	- be somewhere you are needed, just in time.
	- take +1 forward, or give +1 forward to another hunter.
	- retroactively warn someone about an attack, so that it doesn’t happen.
- [ ] **Sacred Oath:** You may bind yourself to a single goal, forsaking something during your quest (e.g. speech, all sustenance but bread and water, alcohol, lying, sex, etc). Get the Keeper’s agreement on this—it should match the goal in importance and difficulty. While you keep your oath and work towards your goal, mark experience at the end of every session and get +1 on any rolls that directly help achieve the goal. If you break the oath, take -1 ongoing until you have atoned.
- [ ] **Mentor:** You have a mentor in the Sect: name them. When you contact your mentor for info, roll +Sharp. On a 10+, you get an answer to your question, no problem. On a 7-9 you choose: they’re either busy and can’t help, or they answer the question but you owe a favour. On a miss, your question causes trouble.
- [ ] **Apprentice:** You have an apprentice: name them. Your job is to teach them the Sect’s ways. They count as an ally: subordinate (motivation: to follow your instructions to the letter).
- [ ] **Helping Hand:** When you successfully help out another hunter, they get +2 instead of the usual +1.
- [ ] **That Old Black Magic:** When you use magic, you can ask a question from the investigate a mystery move as your effect.

## Gear

If your Sect has fighting arts or obsolete gear (see next page) then pick three old-fashioned weapons. If the Sect has modernised or nifty gadgets, you may pick two modern weapons. Otherwise, pick two old-fashioned weapons and one modern weapon.
