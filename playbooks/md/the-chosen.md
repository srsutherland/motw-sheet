# The Chosen

*Your birth was prophesied. You are the Chosen One, and with your abilities you can save the world. If you fail, all will be destroyed. It all rests on you. Only you.*

## Luck

(Luck track placeholder)

Mark luck to change a roll to 12 or avoid all harm from an injury.

**Chosen Special:** When you spend a point of Luck, the Keeper will bring your fate into play.

## Harm

(Harm track placeholder)

When you reach 4 or more, mark unstable.

Unstable: (Unstable injuries will worsen as time passes)

## Experience

(Experience track placeholder)

Whenever you roll and get a total of 6 or less, or when a move tells you to, mark an experience box.

## Fate

You get to decide what sort of fate is in store for you. Pick how you found out about your fate on the reverse side of this sheet.

## Moves

You get all of the basic moves, plus three Chosen moves.
You get these two:

- [x] **Destiny's Plaything:** At the beginning of each mystery, roll +Weird to see what is revealed about your immediate future. On a 10+, the Keeper will reveal a useful detail about the coming mystery. On a 7-9 you get a vague hint about it. On a miss, something bad is going to happen to you.
- [x] **I'm Here For A Reason:** There's something you are destined to do. Work out the details with the Keeper, based on your fate. You cannot die until it comes to pass. If you die in play, then you must spend a Luck point. You will then, somehow, recover or be returned to life. Once your task is done (or you use up all your Luck), all bets are off.

Then pick one of these:

- [ ] **The Big Entrance:** When you make a showy entrance into a dangerous situation, roll +Cool. On 10+ everyone stops to watch and listen until you finish your opening speech. On a 7-9, you pick one person or monster to stop, watch and listen until you finish talking. On a miss, you're marked as the biggest threat by all enemies who are present.
- [ ] **Devastating:** When you inflict harm, you may inflict +1 harm.
- [ ] **Dutiful:** When your fate rears its ugly head, and you act in accordance with any of your fate tags (either heroic or doom) then mark experience. If it's a heroic tag, take +1 forward.
- [ ] **Invincible:** You always count as having 2-armour. This doesn't stack with other protection.
- [ ] **Resilience:** You heal faster than normal people. Any time your harm gets healed, heal an extra point. Additionally, your wounds count as 1-harm less for the purpose of the Keeper's harm moves.

## Gear

You can have protective gear worth 1-armour, if you want.
You have a special weapon you are destined to wield.

### Your Special Weapon

Design your weapon by choosing a form and three business-end options (which are added to the base tags), and a material. For example, if you want a magic sword you could choose the following: handle + blade + long + magic.

**Form (choose 1):**
- [ ] staff (1-harm hand/close)
- [ ] haft (2-harm hand heavy)
- [ ] handle (1-harm hand balanced)
- [ ] chain (1-harm hand area)

**Business-end (choose 3 options):**
- [ ] artifact (add the "magic" tag)
- [ ] spikes (+1 harm, add the "messy" tag)
- [ ] blade (+1 harm)
- [ ] heavy (+1 harm)
- [ ] long (add the "close" tag)
- [ ] throwable (add the "close" tag)
- [ ] chain (add the "area" tag)

**Material (choose 1):**
Finally, pick what material the business-end is made from: add "steel," "cold iron," "silver," "wood," "stone," "bone," "teeth," "obsidian," or anything else you want.

Material: __________

## History

Go around the group again. On your turn, pick one of these for each other hunter:

- [ ] You saved their life, back when they didn't know monsters were real. Tell them what you saved them from.

## Leveling Up

## Improvements

- [ ] Get +1 Charm, max +3
- [ ] Get +1 Cool, max +3
- [ ] Get +1 Sharp, max +3
- [ ] Get +1 Tough, max +3

After you have leveled up five times, you qualify for advanced improvements in addition to these. They're below.

## Advanced Improvements

- [ ] Get +1 to any rating, max +3.
- [ ] Get back one used Luck point.
- [ ] Change this hunter to a new type.
- [ ] Create a second hunter to play as well as this one.
- [ ] Mark two of the basic moves as advanced.
